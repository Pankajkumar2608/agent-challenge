## Overview

The Trading Analyst Agent acts as an AI-powered financial analyst. It leverages two powerful, custom-built tools to interact with the Alpha Vantage API:

1.  **`symbolSearchTool`**: Finds and disambiguates financial assets (stocks, cryptocurrencies, indices) based on user keywords.
2.  **`marketDataTool`**: Fetches a comprehensive suite of technical indicators for a specified asset, complete with robust retry logic and data validation.

The agent interprets this data based on a detailed set of instructions, providing users with a structured, educational, and easy-to-understand technical report.

## Features

-   üîé **Intelligent Symbol Search**: Accurately finds assets and asks for clarification when results are ambiguous.
-   üìä **Comprehensive Data Retrieval**: Fetches Price, RSI, MACD, SMA, EMA, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Oscillator, and On-Balance Volume (OBV).
-   ü§ñ **Structured Analysis**: Presents data in a detailed, easy-to-read markdown format that explains what each indicator means.
-   üéì **Educational Insights**: Provides clear context and interpretation for technical indicators, helping users learn about market analysis.
-   üõ°Ô∏è **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully manages API errors, partial data, or failed searches by informing the user and suggesting next steps.
-   üê≥ **Dockerized**: Ready for containerized deployment with simple build and run commands.

## Technology Stack

-   **Agent Framework**: [Mastra](https://www.mastra.io/)
-   **LLM Service**: [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) with `qwen2:1.5b`
-   **Financial Data**: [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/)
-   **Language**: TypeScript
-   **Database (for memory)**: LibSQL / SQLite

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the Trading Analyst Agent running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/trading-analyst-agent.git
cd trading-analyst-agent

2. Install Dependencies
This project uses pnpm for package management.

pnpm install

3. Set Up Ollama
The agent is designed to run with a local LLM served by Ollama.
a. Install Ollama
Follow the official instructions at ollama.com.
b. Start the Ollama Service
Open a new terminal and run:```bash
ollama serve

**c. Pull and Run the Recommended Model**  
We use `qwen2:1.5b` for its balance of performance and resource efficiency.
```bash
ollama pull qwen2:1.5b
ollama run qwen2:1.5b
Use code with caution.
Why qwen2:1.5b?
Lightweight: Requires only ~1GB of space.
Fast: Delivers quick inference times on a CPU.
Tool Calling: Natively supports the function-calling required by the agent.
Development-Friendly: Perfect for local development and testing.
The Ollama server will run on http://localhost:11434 by default.
4. Configure Environment Variables
The agent needs an API key from Alpha Vantage to fetch financial data.
a. Get a Free API Key
Visit alphavantage.co to claim your free key.
b. Create a .env file
In the root of the project, create a file named .env and add your API key:
Generated env
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY

Env
Running the Agent
Once the setup is complete, you can run the agent locally or using Docker.
Run Locally
Start the agent in development mode. The agent will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.

pnpm run dev


Run with Docker
You can also build and run the agent inside a container.
1. Build the Docker Image

docker build -t trading-analyst-agent .


2. Run the Container
Generated bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env trading-analyst-agent
Use code with caution.

The --env-file .env flag securely passes your API key to the container.
